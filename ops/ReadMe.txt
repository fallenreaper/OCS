How To Do OPORDs:

Candidate:
	You will get read an OPORD.
	You will get a 1-2 hour break prior to receiving a frago.
	
	Pretend this is as if SFC Wolfe or SFC Hendrick is reading the frago to you and get clarification where necessary.
	Do everything we did as if we were running a lane, including sand tables and brief
	Leverage your TLPs and make sure you cover all 8.  (Receive the Mission, Send a Warno, Create a Tenative Plan, Initiate Necessary Troop Movement, Conduct Recon, Complete the Plan, Issue Complete Order, Supervise and Refine)
	If you use sand tables, announce and speak your warnos, say your opord out aloud to practice saying them.
	
	At the end, take a look at your times.  See how you did.  Check to see how well you stick to the 1/3 2/3 rule and if you generally have a shrotened time.

Reader:
	You will read this to the candidate at normal speed.  You will make sure to read the mission twice.
	At the end of reading this, answer questions or requests to repeat information.
	If they ask for ISR, Maps, or Imagary, Intelligence, etc... give them the maps.
	If they request items, say yes or no within reason.
	
	Let that soak in for them and hour or 2 to grasp the concept of the mission.
	
	Pick any 1 frago.
	Start a Stop watch and start reading the selected frago.
	Read it at a normal pace, make sure to read the Mission twice.
	When you are done, ask them if they have any questions or requests.
	If they ask for ISR, Maps, Imagary, Intelligence, etc... give them the maps.  (ISR.pdf)
	If they ask for items, say yes or no based on reason. (This is small squad level infantry tactics)
	When they are done asking questions, write down the time.
	Write down the times they start and stop sand tables, start and stop their opord brief.
	write down the time they finish doing some rehearsals.
	If they ask for time extensions, say yes or no.
	mark the time they are ready to SP
